I'm a research statistician with the [AirFire](https://airfire.org) team at the PNW Research Station, US Forest Service, as part of an [Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE)](https://orise.orau.gov/index.html) fellowship. I apply statistical and spatial analysis (GIS) methods to natural resource management.

Previously, I was part of a river temperature research group using spatial network models to better understand temperature patterns and its drivers. I graduated from the University of Washington with an MS in Statistics in 2015.


# Air Quality Modelling
Goals: Using spatial analysis and statistical methods to model wildfire smoke impacts in real-time.

# Fire Information and Real-time Tools
Goals: Taking advantage of rapid data influx (both "on the ground" fires and "in the sky" satellites) to support our forecasting models and provide scientists, as well as the general public, with the most recent and accurate information we can.

# River Network Models
Goals: Designing monitoring studies and modeling water temperature patterns across river networks. Developing network models which consider the spatial (on braching river networks) and temporal (across time) complexity of thermal regimes that will aid fisheries and freshwater management under a changing climate.
